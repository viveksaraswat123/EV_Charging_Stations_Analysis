# EV_Charging_Stations_Analysis
🔌**EV Charging Dashboard | Tableau Project using Mock Data**

This is a Tableau dashboard project built to analyze the performance of EV (Electric Vehicle) charging stations across major Indian cities.
Since real-time data was not publicly available, a mock dataset was created to simulate realistic scenarios involving energy delivery, revenue generation, charger usage, and operational status.

📊 Key Features:
Revenue Analysis by city and charger type

Monthly trends in billed amount and sessions

Charging Duration, Power Rating, and Energy Delivered (kWh)

Vehicle type usage across cities and years (2W, 3W, 4W, Buses)

Operational status of charging stations (Active vs Inactive)

Payment method trends (Wallet, Net Banking, UPI, Credit Card)

Interactive filters for Year, City, and Charger Type

📍 Tools Used:
Tableau Desktop Public Edition

Excel for mock data preparation

📁 Dashboards Included:
Dashboard1: Revenue & Energy KPIs + Monthly & City-wise Trends

Dashboard2: Station Operational Status + Utilization Rate + Vehicle Usage

Dashboard3: Vehicle Type Trends + Charging Duration + Sessions Per Year

🧠 Learnings:
Practiced KPI tracking, filtering, and multi-dashboard linking

Gained hands-on experience designing interactive visualizations

Simulated a real-world EV infrastructure use case for better data storytelling
